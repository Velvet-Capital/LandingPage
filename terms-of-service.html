          Transactions on BNB Chain or that otherwise involve the use of an
          underlying blockchain or other decentralized or permissioned
          infrastructure (the "Distributed Ledger Technology") require that you
          pay a fee, such as "gas" charges on the BNB Chain network, for the
          computational resources required to perform a transaction on the
          particular Distributed Ledger Technology (such payments and fees,
          "Charges").
        </p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          Velvet does not currently charge any fees for your transactions on the

          open-source smart contracts used by our Website. However, we reserve
          the right to charge fees for your use of the Website and adjust the

          You acknowledge and agree that Velvet has no control over any
          Distributed Ledger Technology transactions, the method of payment of
          any Charges, if applicable, or any actual payments of Charges, if
          applicable. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient
          balance of the applicable Distributed Ledger Technology network tokens
          stored at your Distributed Ledger Technology-compatible wallet address
          ("Distributed Ledger Technology Address") to complete any transaction
          on the Distributed Ledger Technology before initiating such
          transaction.

        <p class="termsHeading">8 OWNERSHIP OF DIGITAL TOKENS</p>

          digital wallets at all times. We do not custody your digital tokens
          and do not have access to, or retain the electronic private key of

          (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum
          Token Standard (ERC-20). Velvet does not control the underlying
          software protocols of any digital tokens accessible on the Website.
          You agree that we are not responsible for the operation, functionality

          highly volatile, and that there are risks associated with digital
          tokens including (but not limited to) those related to adoption,
          speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge
          that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and
          blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may
          increase dramatically at any time. You understand and agree to assume
          full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the

          other enforcement agency or organization, and any private litigation
          based on violations of U.S. securities laws. In particular, you
          acknowledge that unauthorized resale of the tokens on our website, may
          subject you to civil or criminal liability under U.S. securities laws.
        </p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          You should be aware that anyone can create digital tokens via the

        <p class="termsHeading">21 DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</p>
        <p class="spanP">
          Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
          arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Velvet and limits the
          manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of
          arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In
          addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a
          jury trial.
        </p>
        <p class="spanP">
          You and Velvet agree that any dispute arising out of or related to
          this Agreement, including threshold questions of the arbitrability of
          the dispute, is personal to you and Velvet and that any dispute will
          be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought
          as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
          representative proceeding.
        </p>

        <p class="termsPara">
          <span
            >Except for small claims disputes in which you or Velvet seeks to
            bring an individual action in small claims court located in the
            county or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside or disputes
            in which you or Velvet seeks injunctive or other equitable relief
            for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and
            Velvet waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute
            arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Website resolved
            in court.</span
          >
          Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Velvet or
          relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Velvet
          and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written
          notice of your claim ("Notice") to Velvet by email at
          info@velvet.capital. The Notice must include your name, residence
          address, email address, and telephone number, describe the nature and
          basis of the claim and set forth the specific relief sought. Our
          notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you
          and Velvet cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within
          ninety (90) days after such Notice is received, then either party may
          submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the JAMS.
          All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential,
          binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings
          will be held in the BVI, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive
          Arbitration Rules & Procedures ("JAMS Rules"). The most recent version
          of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS Site and are hereby
          incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you
          have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to
          read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair
          or should not apply for any reason.
        </p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          You and Velvet agree that the enforceability of this Section 21 will
          be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration
          Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent
          permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and
          the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make
          all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to
          grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including
          the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator
          may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate
          more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or
          representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving
          more than one individual.
        </p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          The arbitrator, Velvet, and you will maintain the confidentiality of
          any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not
          limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for
          purposes of the arbitration or related to the disputes. The arbitrator
          will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard
          confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of
          confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is
          necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the
          merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary
          remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration
          award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is
          otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
        </p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          You and Velvet agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will
          pay all AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Velvet,
          Velvet will pay all AAA fees and costs.
        </p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          Any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be filed
          within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is
          permanently barred, which means that you and Velvet will not have the
          right to assert the claim.
        </p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of
          the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 21 by emailing
          us at info@velvet.capital. In order to be effective, the opt-out
          notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate
          your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of
          binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in
          accordance with Section 22.
        </p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          If any portion of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable or
          unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision will
          be severed from this Agreement, severance of the unenforceable or
          unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of
          this Section 21 or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any
          remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 21, and to
          the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class,
          collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be
          litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
          arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims
          will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in
          arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 21 is found to
          prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that
          provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to
          be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 21
          will be enforceable.
        </p>
        <p class="termsHeading">22 GOVERNING LAW</p>
        <p class="termsPara">
          The interpretation and enforcement of the Agreement, and any dispute

          and enforced in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands
          , as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles
          that would cause the application of the laws of any other
          jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to
          the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any
          court having jurisdiction. You agree that the British Virgin Islands
          is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for
          court proceedings in the event that this Agreement's binding
          arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.
